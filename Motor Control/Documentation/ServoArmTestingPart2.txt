This will be about the results of the next week after the first testing results. 

Previously I had stated that one of the big errors that we were recieving was that the code kept returning
to 0 after inputing a number. The problem was in the area where we were converting the input into an int. 
For some reason that line of code because we were immediately trying to convert it caused it to keep looking
for an input and would go to zero if there was not another input. So if we went instead to string then to 
an int it fixed the issue of going back to zero. So now the servo arm when asked for an input will now go to
that location.

The next issue that was fixed was that when we did an input of 180 degrees when it was at 0 it would go more
than 180 degrees. We tried recalibrating to see if that would fix the issue but the movement still was too
large. To fix this we did some estimating to see if multiplying the input by a number to reduce the number 
would give us better results. This actually made the results much better. We ended up finding a sweet spot
of around 0.75 being the number to multiply and now the servo arm moves at a perfect accuracy

The next problem that we need to fix is the current going into the arduino is too much, and is overloading 
the arduino causing it to keep disconnecting. We need to find a fix to that issue next week.
