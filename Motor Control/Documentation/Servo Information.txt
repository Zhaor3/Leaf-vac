Work for Servo Motor
First learning about the servo motor

1. Small Servo motor can take from 4.8 to 6.8 Volts

2. We are planning on giving it 5 Volts 

3. So the max current that this servo can handle at the max stall is 2.1 Amps

4. The Raspberry Pi 4 model b  recommended PSU current capacity is 3 Amps

5. The Raspberry Pi bare bone activation current usage is 600 mA
   
6. Raspberry Pi pins can only handle up to 16mA so we must use a motor driver to separate the power and then connect the control to the 
   Raspberry Pi so that we donâ€™t fry pins.

7. The motor driver L298N can handle up to 2 Amps supposedly so it should be fine when we use it for the servo and if we ever get that high     
   up at a stall.
