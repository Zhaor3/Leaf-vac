New information about servo controller:

Currently, we were worried about the current provided to the servos that are going to be used for the arm.
We saw the required amps that we might not have been able to reach but we have figured out a workaround if what 
we know about the servos are true.
We can have the battery voltage and current supply power the servos directly with the usage of a voltage
divider that would provide the proper voltage required for the servo. For example, the servo that requires
6 voltage we could create a simple voltage divider that would split the voltage but maintain the needed 
current for the servo.

We also learned that we did not need an enable pin for our motor driver when we were creating our 
circuit we have seen that having to input pins was enough to control the wheels precisely, and all we need to 
do is just include the other pins for the other side of the of the robot so we can control both at the same time
