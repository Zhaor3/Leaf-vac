I am currently devising a way to use our battery and to decrease the voltage supplied to the motor to 6 volts
so that the motor does not get burnt because of an overload of voltage. We used a simple circuit with two 
resistors at first. In which we had the first resistor as 2000, and the second one as 1000. The input is 18
this would lead to the output over the 2000 to be 6 volts so that we could provide to the motor.

We found a major issue when thinking about this solution, as the voltage would drop down but the current 
would still be to large and would possibly hurt the motor pins because it is too much current. 

Our thought to fix this problem was to create parallel resitors to try lowering the current. The issue is if
we then connect this to the motor, because the resistance in the motor is so low it would cause everything to
go through the motor instead of the resistors because it would go through the path of least resistance.
