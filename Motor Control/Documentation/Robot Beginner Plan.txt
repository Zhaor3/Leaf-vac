We have a 42,40 stepper motor 
This supposedly has a rated voltage of 4.83 volts
We are using two, so the recommended for both should be around 9.66, or around 10 volts
These two stepper motors are going to be used for the movement of the robot


We are using 2 ryobi battery 18 volts


Servo to use 8 to 9 volts 
This is going to be used for the arm

We also need to supply volts to the camera

We need to make sure that we reduce te voltage of the ryobi batteries so that we can split it into two 4.83 volts to go into the steppers, then we need around 9 volts to go into stepper, probably use the second battery so that we can use one for the camera.
