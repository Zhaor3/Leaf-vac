	Connecting the servo to the arduino was simple, the required pins were just the ground, voltage, and
the pin to control the servo. After connecting the pins to the arduino we created simple code to see if
arm would move. The code worked in which it would move to the positions and was looped to go back and forth.

	The second code we implemented was to allow for inputs to be placed to see if we could control the movement
more accurately. It would somewhat work in which it would move to the position but there was a bug in the 
code in which the position would automatically move back to an incorrect position.
	We are still attempting to adjust the code to fix any minor issues to properly control the arm.
What we are aiming for is to have sections of code that are functions that we can easily use when we want 
to move the arm with a controller to press a button and have it move.
	Because we are working with 5 servo motors, it will be difficult to connect and control the code
for all of them as we need to have them moving in seperate ways. We will be testing that out at another time.
